# Analyzing sentiment in drug reviews

Pharmaceutical companies develop drugs based on intensive research and clinical trials. However, clinical trials provide a limited resource to examine the drugs and their side effects. The patients' reviews after mass production are a great source of information for pharmaceutical companies to learn more about customer reaction to their products, discover potential problems before they occur, and better allocate their resources. 

In this project, we will aim to predict whether or not a customer review is negative (rating <4) based on the review, analyze what indicators in a review make it most likely to be negative for different types of drugs and which patients tend to have more negative reviews.

This data set contains patientsâ€™ review and rating of 3436 different drugs. The condition of the patients for which the drug is taken is given and the number of people who found the review useful. The data is from UCI Machine Learning Repository:
